# White Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the quality of white wine using various machine learning algorithms based on physicochemical characteristics such as acidity, residual sugar, alcohol, and sulfur dioxide levels.

## Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Number of instances: 4898  
- Features: 11 chemical attributes + 1 target (quality)

## üîç Problem Statement

Wine quality is often evaluated by human tasters, which can be subjective and time-consuming. By using machine learning models, we aim to provide a faster, more consistent, and objective prediction of wine quality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization

## Models Tested

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
